## Project: Search and Sample Return
---


**The goals / steps of this project are the following:**  

**Training / Calibration**  

* Download the simulator and take data in "Training Mode"
* Test out the functions in the Jupyter Notebook provided
* Add functions to detect obstacles and samples of interest (golden rocks)
* Fill in the `process_image()` function with the appropriate image processing steps (perspective transform, color threshold etc.) to get from raw images to a map.  The `output_image` you create in this step should demonstrate that your mapping pipeline works.
* Use `moviepy` to process the images in your saved dataset with the `process_image()` function.  Include the video you produce as part of your submission.

**Autonomous Navigation / Mapping**

* Fill in the `perception_step()` function within the `perception.py` script with the appropriate image processing functions to create a map and update `Rover()` data (similar to what you did with `process_image()` in the notebook). 
* Fill in the `decision_step()` function within the `decision.py` script with conditional statements that take into consideration the outputs of the `perception_step()` in deciding how to issue throttle, brake and steering commands. 
* Iterate on your perception and decision function until your rover does a reasonable (need to define metric) job of navigating and mapping.

### Notebook Analysis
#### 1. Run the functions provided in the notebook on test images (first with the test data provided, next on data you have recorded). Add/modify functions to allow for color selection of obstacles and rock samples.


```python
# Identify pixels above the threshold
# Threshold of RGB > 160 does a nice job of identifying ground pixels only
def color_thresh(img, rgb_thresh=(160, 160, 160)):
    # Create an array of zeros same xy size as img, but single channel
    color_select = np.zeros_like(img[:, :, 0])
    # Require that each pixel be above all three threshold values in RGB
    # above_thresh will now contain a boolean array with "True"
    # where threshold was met
    above_thresh = (img[:, :, 0] > rgb_thresh[0]) \
        & (img[:, :, 1] > rgb_thresh[1]) \
        & (img[:, :, 2] > rgb_thresh[2])
    # Index the array of zeros with the boolean array and set to 1
    color_select[above_thresh] = 1
    # Return the binary image
    return color_select
```

```python
# Define a function to convert from image coords to rover coords
def rover_coords(binary_img):
    # Identify nonzero pixels
    ypos, xpos = binary_img.nonzero()
    # Calculate pixel positions with reference to the rover position being at the
    # center bottom of the image.
    x_pixel = -(ypos - binary_img.shape[0]).astype(np.float)
    y_pixel = -(xpos - binary_img.shape[1]/2).astype(np.float)
    return x_pixel, y_pixel

# Define a function to convert to radial coords in rover space

def to_polar_coords(x_pixel, y_pixel):
    # Convert (x_pixel, y_pixel) to (distance, angle)
    # in polar coordinates in rover space
    # Calculate distance to each pixel
    dist = np.sqrt(x_pixel**2 + y_pixel**2)
    # Calculate angle away from vertical for each pixel
    angles = np.arctan2(y_pixel, x_pixel)
    return dist, angles

# Define a function to map rover space pixels to world space

def rotate_pix(xpix, ypix, yaw):
    # Convert yaw to radians
    yaw_rad = yaw * np.pi / 180
    xpix_rotated = (xpix * np.cos(yaw_rad)) - (ypix * np.sin(yaw_rad))

    ypix_rotated = (xpix * np.sin(yaw_rad)) + (ypix * np.cos(yaw_rad))
    # Return the result
    return xpix_rotated, ypix_rotated

def translate_pix(xpix_rot, ypix_rot, xpos, ypos, scale):
    # Apply a scaling and a translation
    xpix_translated = (xpix_rot / scale) + xpos
    ypix_translated = (ypix_rot / scale) + ypos
    # Return the result
    return xpix_translated, ypix_translated

# Define a function to apply rotation and translation (and clipping)
# Once you define the two functions above this function should work

def pix_to_world(xpix, ypix, xpos, ypos, yaw, world_size, scale):
    # Apply rotation
    xpix_rot, ypix_rot = rotate_pix(xpix, ypix, yaw)
    # Apply translation
    xpix_tran, ypix_tran = translate_pix(xpix_rot, ypix_rot, xpos, ypos, scale)
    # Perform rotation, translation and clipping all at once
    x_pix_world = np.clip(np.int_(xpix_tran), 0, world_size - 1)
    y_pix_world = np.clip(np.int_(ypix_tran), 0, world_size - 1)
    # Return the result
    return x_pix_world, y_pix_world
```
#### 2. Populate the `process_image()` function with the appropriate analysis steps to map pixels identifying navigable terrain, obstacles and rock samples into a worldmap.  Run `process_image()` on your test data using the `moviepy` functions provided to create video output of your result. 


#### 3. Fill in the `perception_step()` (at the bottom of the `perception.py` script) and `decision_step()` (in `decision.py`) functions in the autonomous mapping scripts and an explanation is provided in the writeup of how and why these functions were modified as they were. Apply the above functions in succession and update the Rover state accordingly

#### 2. Launching in autonomous mode your rover can navigate and map autonomously.  Explain your results and how you might improve them in your writeup.  

**Note: running the simulator with different choices of resolution and graphics quality may produce different results, particularly on different machines!  Make a note of your simulator settings (resolution and graphics quality set on launch) and frames per second (FPS output to terminal by `drive_rover.py`) in your writeup when you submit the project so your reviewer can reproduce your results.**

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
